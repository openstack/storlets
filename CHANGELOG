  * Minor bug fixes

storlets (0.6.0)

storlets (0.4.0, Openstack Ocata)
  * Big-Tent changes:
     - Restructurng the repository to be OpenStack 'compliant'
     - Port s2aio to devstack for Swift and Keystone
     - Port installation to Xenial
     - Move to Keystone V3

  * Initial IPython integration: Deploy a storlet from IPython.

  * Better coverage of python functional tests.

  * Various minor improvements and bug fixes.

storlets (0.3.0, Openstack Newton)

  * Python support for writing storlets. This large
    chunk of work involved refactoring, improving and
    unit testing much of the code that deals with
    storlets invocation in general.

  * Storlets can be invoked on multiple objects. Multiple
    objects can be specified when invoking a storlet on GET/COPY.
    With multiple inputs, the storlet is invoked on the proxy with
    multiple input streams (as opposed to the traditional single input
    stream).

  * Introduction of Storlets ACLs. The storlet middleware now supports
    a POST verb for allowing a certain user READ access to a container
    ony via a certain storlet. Thus, a user which has no read access
    to a container can get access only if the request has the appropriate
    storlet specified in the X-Run-Storlet header.

  * Aligning the storlets team procedures and repo towards becoming part
    of the bit tent. This includes moving the weekly meetings to
    #openstack-meeting, change the review process to include 2 reviewers,
    initial py35 test env, etc.

storlets (0.2.0, Openstack Mitaka)

  * First storlets release since it was open sourced.

  * Most of the code has been refactored to ease maintainability
    this includes: breaking the middleware to base, proxy and object handlers
    restructure the gateway code to allow easier addition of new gateways
    simplification of the swift-docker communicartion code

  * Unit tests has been added to most of the python code

  * The documentation has been re-written and updated with focus
    on installation

  * functional tests have been enriched

  * Added the ability to invoke a storlet on copy including support
    for swift COPY middleware

  * Added the ability to process single range requests on object nodes
    to allow better performance when working with Spark.

  * This release is tested with Swift 2.7.0, and Openstack Keystone Mitaka

storlets (0.1.0, Openstack Mitaka)
