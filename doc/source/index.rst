Welcome to storlets' documentation!
===================================

Storlets extend Swift with the ability to run user defined computations
- called storlets - near the data in a secure and isolated manner.
A storlet is a compiled and packaged code (e.g. a .jar file) that can be
uploaded to Swift as any other object.
Once uploaded the storlet can be invoked over data objects in Swift.

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree.
