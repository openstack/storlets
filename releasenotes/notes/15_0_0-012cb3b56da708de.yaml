    This release supports the latest OpenStack Swift release and the updated
    tested runtimes globally defined in OpenStack project.

features:
  - |
    Now Storlets is tested in Ubuntu Noble (24.04).

fixes:
  - |
    Re-added the static script for storlet-daeamon and storlet-daemon-factory.
    These can be used in case the script generated during installation does not
    work as start script in container (For example when storlets is installed
    in venv while system python is used to launch the daemons). This is
    especially useful in Ubuntu Noble which does not allow direct installation
    to system python using pip.
