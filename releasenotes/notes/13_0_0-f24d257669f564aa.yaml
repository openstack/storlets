    This version includes various new functionalities to improve operation and
    use case coverage of Storlets.

features:
  - |
    Now storlets is tested with CentOS 9 Stream. Note that the docker-ce
    package is required instead of the default container tool (podman) in
    CentOS. Podman suport is still being worked on.

  - |
    Now swift middleware detects a symlink object and run applications using
    the target object, instead of the symlink object itself.

  - |
    The new ``max_extra_resources`` option has been added to swift middleware.
    This option determines the maximum number of extra input resources, so
    that operators can prohibit client requests with two many extra resources,
    which may consume large amount of resources.

  - |
    Now swift middleware supports executing storlet application in object PUT
    with using existing objects as extra input resources. Previously it was
    possible only in object GET.

  - |
    The following options were added to docker gateway. These options allows
    limiting resources used by storlet application containers.

    - ``container_cpu_period``
    - ``container_cpu_quota``
    - ``container_mem_limit``
    - ``container_cpuset_cpus``
    - ``container_cpuset_mems``
    - ``container_pids_limit``

  - |
    The docker gateway no longer requires the entry point script within
    application container images.

deprecations:
  - |
    Some of the docker gateway options were deprecated and will be replaced
    by the new options completely in a future release.

    - ``docker_repo`` will be replaced by ``container_image_namespace``
    - ``default_docker_image_name`` will be replaced by
      ``default_container_image_name``
