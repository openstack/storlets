    This is the first release which supports Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish).
    Some improvements to similify upgrade and allow more flexible tunings have
    been added.

features:
  - |
    Now storlets support Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish).

  - |
    The following new options have been added to docker gateway.

    - ``sandbox_ping_interval``
    - ``stop_linux_container_timeout``

  - |
    The following options of docker gateway now supports float values.
    Previously these options converted float values to integer values.

    - ``restart_linux_container_timeout``
    - ``storlet_timeout``

upgrade:
  - |
    Now a storlet application uses the default python (python3) unless it
    requires a specific minor version. Make sure the default python3 command
    is available in runtime images.

  - |
    Default value of the ``default_docker_image_name`` option has been updated
    and now is set to ``storlet_engine_image``. Please make sure this option
    is configured in case the previous image name should be used.
